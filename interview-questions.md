# ASSESSMENT 4: Interview Practice Questions
Answer the following questions.

First, without external resources. Challenge yourself to answer from memory.

Then, research the question to expand on your answer. Even if you feel you have answered the question completely on your own, there is always something more to learn. Write your researched answer in your OWN WORDS.  

1. What are props in React?

  Your answer:
Props are the parameters of a React component, operating the same way as function arguments 
  Researched answer:
React Props are similar to the argument of a function in JavaScript



2. What is a DOM event?

  Your answer: A DOM event refers to when there is any change or interaction with a webpage. 

  Researched answer: A DOM event is when JavaScript is executing on the webpage. 



3. What is object-oriented programming? How is it different than functional programming?

  Your answer: Object-oriented programming is a development practice of creating reusable blocks of code as templates which are used to create subsequent objects

  Researched answer: Object-oriented programming allows developers to create classes as blueprints to make instances of those objects as easy as possible. Easily assigned key values allows for the implementation of the blueprint and creates an object with its own properties based off the original classes values.



4. What is the difference between a Float and an Integer in Ruby?

  Your answer: Ruby will only return the data type of the input, if an integer divided by an integer results in a decimal it will be rounded to the nearest integer, but if a float is introduced in the equation the return will also be a float. Regardless if there are integers as values in the equation or function. 

  Researched answer: Decimals in Ruby, known as floats, are "imprecise" they are never exact because they run "forever" and because of this it can affect the expected boolean value of a function or equation. 



5. Ruby has an implicit return. What does that mean?

  Your answer: Implicit return means the final line of a method is automatically returned

  Researched answer: Ruby does not require the keyword return to be used on the final line of a method to return, simply the code needing to be returned.



## Looking Ahead: Terms for Next Week

1. Instance Variable: An instance variable in Ruby begins with the "@" symbol and is restricted to whatever the object refers to. Two different objects of the same class can have different values for their instance variables.

2. PostgreSQL: A database management system designed to safely secure and scale complicated data. 

3. Ruby on Rails: A framework built for Ruby, the gives developers default structures for databases, pages and services.

4. ORM: Object Relational Mapping is a way to provide an object-oriented layer between databases and OOP languages without having to write additional SQL queries. 

5. Active Record: The active record is a ORM pattern type, mapping data within the code.
